To emulate the default Acquia Cloud environment with Drupal VM you should create a `config.yml` and override a few defaults from `default.config.yml`. For an up-to-date example, use [BLT's `config.yml`](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/8.x/scripts/drupal-vm/config.yml). Some of the variables in the BLT example are customized for BLT and you should be looking specifically at `vagrant_box`, `php_version`, and `php_packages_extra`.
